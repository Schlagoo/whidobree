        <p class="text">With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below,
            users and data subjects have the right
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
                processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
                also Art. 15 GDPR);

            <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if
                further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
                per Art. 18 GDPR;
            </li>
            <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
            discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per
            Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible
            or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
            recipients.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right
                to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f)
                GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
                permissible.

        <p class="text">Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon

        <h2>Server data</h2>
        <p class="text">For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us
            or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These
            server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which
            you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as
            the IP address from which you visited our site.
        </p>
        <p class="text">The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association
            with any other of your data.
        </p>
        <p class="text">The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
            interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.
        </p>
        <p class="text">The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued
            storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded
            from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p class="text">If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be
            used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer
            your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.
        </p>
        <p class="text">The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

        </p>
        <p class="text">Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there
            is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.

        <h2>Social media links via graphics</h2>
        <p class="text">We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The
            integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on
            our own servers prevents the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their display.
            Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of the respective
            social network.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit
            to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the United States.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and
            time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network,
            however, the network operator might assign the information collected about your visit to our site to
            your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored
            your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to
            log out of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks
            also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.
        </p>
